I was one of the top contributors for [Humanity's Last Exam](https://lastexam.ai)! 14 of my submissions were accepted, 12 public and 2 private, spanning computational game theory, algebra, and general relativity. I was awarded $500 from Scale AI for being a top 550 contributor. Thanks to [Richard Stanley](https://math.mit.edu/~rstan/) my Erdős number is now 3.
