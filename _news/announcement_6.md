Humanity's Last Exam is released

---

Total of 14 of my submissions were accepted. 

12 of which are public and 2 are private. 

Many problems are from niche game theory and some problems in algebra and general relativity.

One or more of my submitted questions has been selected as part of the top 550 for HLE which won me a total prize of $500 from Scale AI.

Thanks to [Richard Stanley](https://math.mit.edu/~rstan/) my Erd≈ës number is now 3.
