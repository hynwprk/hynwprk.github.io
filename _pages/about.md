I am currently on leave from CMU to pursue an exciting opportunity.

I am broadly interested in machine learning, particularly in generative models built from first mathematical principles. 

In my first two years of undergrad at Carnegie Mellon, I have completed 12 [graduate level courses](/assets/pdf/list.txt) in physics, mathematics, and computer science.

I previously was a [research intern](https://www.lgresearch.ai/news/view?seq=438) at [LG AI Research](https://www.lgresearch.ai). Where I worked on Riemannian Diffusion Models.

I also work on international technology cooperation. Find my recent involvement at the [U.S.-ROK-Japan Trilateral Global Leadership Youth Summit](/assets/pdf/trilateral.pdf).

My [erdos number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd≈ës_number) is 3.

I use [colemak](https://colemak.com).

I have recieved a scoe of 25 on the 2024 Putnam Competition placing top 580th in North America.

I spend a lot of time at different universities around the world.
