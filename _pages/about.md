I am currently on leave from CMU and have been spending time in Europe and Asia.

I am broadly interested in machine learning, particularly in generative models built from first mathematical principles. 

In my first two years of undergrad at Carnegie Mellon, I took 12 [graduate level courses](/assets/pdf/list.txt) in physics, mathematics, and computer science.

I was a [research intern](https://www.lgresearch.ai/news/view?seq=438) at [LG AI Research](https://www.lgresearch.ai) where I worked on Generative Modelling for Manifolds.

I also think a lot about technology and society. I represented the Republic of Korea at the recent [U.S.-ROK-Japan Trilateral Global Leadership Youth Summit](/assets/pdf/trilateral.pdf).

I have received a score of 25 on the 2023 Putnam Competition placing top 580th in North America.

I was a top contributor for Humanity's Last Exam which made my [erdos number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdős_number) 3.

I spend a lot of time at different universities around the world. 

I use [colemak](https://colemak.com).
